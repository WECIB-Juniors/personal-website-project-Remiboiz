            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I’m a student who really likes tech stuff and learning how things work. I got into coding because I thought it was cool how you can make your own apps and websites from scratch. I’m still learning but I’m starting to get the hang of it.</p>
    <p>Right now I just want to keep getting better at programming and maybe make something people actually use one day. I’ve been working on small projects and trying to learn from YouTube videos and practice sites.</p>
    <p>In the future I just want to do something creative with tech, maybe build apps or games, or even my own business. I’m still figuring things out but I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>
